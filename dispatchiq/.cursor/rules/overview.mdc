# 🚨 SignalOne — Real-Time Emergency Dispatch AI Copilot

## One-Sentence Pitch

**SignalOne is an AI copilot that listens to emergency calls, tracks critical incident details, and tells dispatchers the right question to ask next — in real time.**

---

## Demo Goal

During the demo, a **real person places a live phone call** to a phone number.

As the call unfolds:

* The caller speaks naturally
* Call audio is transcribed **live**
* An AI system continuously processes the conversation
* A dispatcher dashboard updates in real time with:

  * Auto-filled incident details
  * Highlighted missing critical information
  * A **single prioritized “Next Best Question”** to ask

The demo prioritizes **reliability, clarity, and trust** over production completeness.

---

## Core User Flow

1. Caller dials a phone number (via telephony provider)
2. Call audio is streamed to **Deepgram** for real-time transcription
3. Deepgram returns partial and final transcript updates
4. Each transcript update is sent to the backend (**Node.js**)
5. The backend sends transcript context to **Gemini (LLM)** for processing
6. Gemini:

   * Extracts structured incident data
   * Detects missing critical information
   * Generates one prioritized next best question
7. Processed state is stored and synced via **Supabase**
8. The frontend dispatcher dashboard updates instantly

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Live Call Transcription

* Real-time speech-to-text using **Deepgram**
* Streaming transcription with low latency
* Supports partial and final transcript updates

---

### 2. Structured Information Extraction

The AI continuously extracts and updates a structured incident state, including:

* **Location**
* **Emergency type** (medical, police, fire, etc.)
* **Injuries**
* **Threat level**
* **Number of people involved**
* **Caller role** (victim, witness, bystander, etc.)

The structured state evolves as more information is revealed during the call.

---

### 3. Missing Information Detection

* Tracks which required fields are still unknown
* Prioritizes high-impact gaps (e.g. missing location)
* Understands dependencies between fields

---

### 4. Next Best Question Suggestion

* Displays **exactly one question at a time**
* Question is:

  * Context-aware
  * Urgency-driven
  * Calm and dispatcher-appropriate
* Updates dynamically as new information is received

---

### 5. Urgency Indicator

* Real-time incident severity classification:

  * **Low**
  * **Medium**
  * **Critical**
* Based on extracted data and missing critical fields

---

### 6. Human-in-the-Loop Control

* Dispatcher remains fully in control
* Dispatcher can:

  * Ignore AI suggestions
  * Override extracted fields
  * Proceed manually at any time
* AI acts as an **assistant**, not a decision-maker

---

## Stretch Features (Optional)

* Automatic post-call incident summary
* Dispatcher tone modes (calm / assertive)
* Explicit warnings when critical information is missing
* Training and replay mode for dispatcher education
* Multi-language transcription and extraction

---

## Technical Stack

### Backend

* **Node.js**
* Handles:

  * Audio/transcript ingestion
  * LLM orchestration
  * State management
  * Real-time updates to frontend

### Database & Realtime Sync

* **Supabase**
* Used for:

  * Incident state storage
  * Transcript storage
  * Realtime subscriptions to update the UI
  * Lightweight auth (if needed)

### Speech-to-Text

* **Deepgram**
* Real-time streaming transcription
* Partial + final transcript updates

### AI / LLM

* **Gemini**
* Responsibilities:

  * Structured data extraction
  * Missing information reasoning
  * Next best question generation
* Invoked continuously as transcript updates arrive

### Frontend

* Web-based dispatcher dashboard (React or similar)
* Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime or WebSockets
* Minimal, calm, dispatcher-first UI

---

## Key Design Constraints

* AI **augments dispatchers — it does not replace them**
* The UI must prioritize **clarity and calm**
* Only **one next best question** is shown at any time
* Demo reliability > production completeness
* The system should feel trustworthy, not intrusive

---

## Success Criteria for Demo

* Live phone call works end-to-end
* Transcription appears in near real time
* Incident fields populate progressively
* Missing critical info is clearly highlighted
* The AI consistently suggests sensible next questions
* Dispatcher UI feels helpful, not overwhelming

---

## Guiding Principle

> *“Reduce chaos by turning noise into one clear next step.”*
